        <p>White Water vs. Sea Kayaks</p>
        
        Each of these are uniquely designed for the circumstances. White water kayaks are built for maneuverability and sea kayaks are built for stability and speed.

        <ul>


            <li>White water have rounded hulls for easier contact with the water </li>
            <li>White water kayaks are also shorter in length and have minimal chines, making it easier for the paddler to maneuver through fast flowing water </li>
            <li>Sea kayaks have flat hulls and long chines for better stability, making them much faster than white water kayaks</li>
            <li>Sea kayaks are built to give the paddler more distance per stroke</li>

        </ul>
